When managing transportation and logistics, accurate and up-to-date trip metrics are essential for making informed decisions, optimizing routes, and improving customer satisfaction. Manual data processing and reporting quickly becomes a drain on resources, automation saves time and reduces errors.

Many teams start with Excel: formulas, pivot tables, and sometimes VBA macros. Learning VBA can be worthwhile, but if you're investing time in a programming language for data work, R and Python are the common choices. I personally chose R because it has many libraries tailored to data-analysis pipelines and idioms that are familiar to people used to spreadsheet formulas.

## Data collection

The first step is defining the dataset and the features of interest. In our case we exported a sample CSV from a telematics API with trip-level details. Key features include `start_time`, `end_time`, `distance`, and `load_weight`. Defining these features up front helps identify the KPIs that matter for monitoring operations.

## Data Processing

Once the data is loaded into R, you can use R’s data manipulation tools to calculate the metrics needed for the report. The `dplyr` package makes these calculations clean and expressive.

Here’s a simple example. We compute trip duration (minutes), average speed (km/h), and revenue using a configurable `rate_per_km`. (Replace `rate_per_km` with your actual rate or a formula that matches your pricing model.)


```r
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

rate_per_km <- 0.10

trip_metrics <- trip_data %>%
  mutate(
    start_time = ymd_hms(start_time),
    end_time   = ymd_hms(end_time),
    duration   = as.numeric(difftime(end_time, start_time, units = "mins")),
    avg_speed  = ifelse(duration > 0, distance / (duration / 60), NA_real_),
  )
```

Example summaries you might include in the report:

```r
# Totals and averages
total_distance <- sum(trip_metrics$distance, na.rm = TRUE)
average_speed  <- mean(trip_metrics$avg_speed, na.rm = TRUE)
total_revenue  <- sum(trip_metrics$revenue, na.rm = TRUE)

total_distance
average_speed
total_revenue
```

## Generating the report

One option is to use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create reproducible reports that embed code, output, and explanation in one file. R Markdown supports HTML, PDF and Word outputs, and can be rendered on a schedule (e.g., with cron or RStudio Connect) or on demand.

Another option is [R Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), which allows you to build interactive dashboards where users can explore data, filter by time periods, and drill down into specific metrics. Shiny apps can be deployed on a server or hosted with services like [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

A few practical tips:

- Use `knitr::kable()` or `gt` for clean tables.
- Use `ggplot2` for visualizations (time series of distance, heatmaps of routes, speed distributions).
- Keep code chunks small and annotated so the report is both readable and reproducible.
- Add a short summary at the top for team members who want the highlights.

## Conclusion

Automating metric calculation and report generation with R reduces manual effort, improves consistency, and makes it easier to track performance over time.
