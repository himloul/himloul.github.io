My name is Hamza, a Data Scientist with experience in incorporating AI models (LLMs) in services. I'm also interested in system design, game development, IoT, robotics, and embedded systems. 

Here you will find some of my [[posts/ | posts]] to various things that I find interesting.

In my free time, I usually explore game development, you can check some of my open-source projects on GitHub. I am also an illustrator, check my [sketches](hobbies/sketches.md).

If you want to collaborate or see my resume, check my [resume](assets/files/resume.pdf) and [GitHub](https://github.com/himloul).
