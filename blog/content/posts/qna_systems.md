## Introduction

During the last four months, I've been working on a professional project, to develop a Conversational chatbot able to answer user queries related to documents and databases.

during this work, I gathered multiple observations, 

- Open-domain or closed-domain Question Answering system,
- Single-turn or multi-turn conversation
- Interact directly with OpenAI endpoints or build an Agent
- When having multiple documents similar semantically, it is challenging to retrieve the right context chunk.
- Extracting the text from unstructured documents can be challenging
