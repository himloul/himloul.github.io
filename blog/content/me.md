Hey there! My name is Hamza, and I'm a passionate NLP Engineer and Data Scientist with experience in incorporating NLP models in systems, implementing Transformer-based language models, and developing data and analytics web apps. I'm also interested in system design, game development, IoT, robotics, and embedded systems.

In my free time, I usually explore LLM use cases, create cool web apps or draw fun doodles. I love giving back to the community by sharing information on my GitHub repos. Besides software and math, I am an illustrator, check my [artworks](https://www.behance.com/himl) ðŸŽ¨.
